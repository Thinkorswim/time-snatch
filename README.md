# Time Sntach #

## Block websites, control your browsing patterns and beat procrastination. ##

Time Snatch boosts your productivity by allowing you to limit the amount of time you spend on distracting websites.

You can completely block off a website or allow yourself to enjoy it for a few minutes (or hours) per day. After navigating to a distracting site you will be redirected to a productive one of your choice or to our default inspiring web page that will throw motivating quotes at you.

Time Snatch is lightweight, reliable and secure. It gives you the flexibility to block and manage each website individually.

Any comments, suggestions and ideas are welcome! Your feedback is invaluable and the extension will evolve depending on YOUR needs. Expect frequent updates and quick responses.

The "Read your browsing history" permission is needed to check whether the current website you are visiting matches any of the ones you have blocked. The extension never saves, sends or uses any of this information for other purposes.
